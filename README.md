YOU SHOULDN'T COPY AND PASTE THE CFGS

I have an AMD Athlon 3000g, so if you have one as well this config could help your performance.

My sensitvity is 12.67.
Monitor Coeffecient Distance is 1.60.

I disabled graphic content, it removes blood.

Never touch the graphics tab or it will reset all the settings and you'll have to restart the game.

Instead do each setting invidually or adjust them to your needs then set both of them to read only and make sure that each config have the same settings.
