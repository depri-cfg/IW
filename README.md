I have an AMD Athlon 3000g, so if you have one as well this config could help your performance.

I have disabled graphic content, it removes blood.

My sensitvity is 12.67.
Monitor Coeffecient Distance is 1.60.

Never touch the graphics tab or it will reset all the settings and you'll have to restart the game.

The cfg disables music and voicechat.
