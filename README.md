YOU SHOULDN'T COPY AND PASTE THE CFGS

I have an AMD Athlon 3000g, so if you have one as well this config could help your performance.

My sensitvity is 12.67.
Monitor Coeffecient Distance is 1.60.

I disabled graphic content, it removes blood.

Never touch the graphics tab or it will reset all the settings and you'll have to restart the game.
